## Getting started

* `git clone git@github.com:seamonkeys/hellomonkeys.git` and then got into that directory (eg. `cd hellomonkeys`)


## Things we'll try and get you to learn

* java - probably use springboot, that seems good enough 
* javascript - using yarn as the package manager, and react as the framework


For the java people:
* go to `/api` directory

For the javascript people:
* go to `/ui` directory
